# pygame_base
## What is it?
A simple extensible Python based game engine for 2D sprite based projects.

## How do I use it?
For the minute the aim is to be no more complicated than just clone and extend, eventually it might turn into some more user friendly libraries. Development and extension will be organic through demo development.
1. Install Python 2.7
2. Install pygame
  * The recommended method is to use pip (pip install pygame) but you can get the standard packages from [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/overview)
